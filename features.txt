1. Vertical Barcode (with Animation)

    Use a glowing vertical barcode on the side of your landing page.
    Make it dynamic, so the lines flicker and change width slightly, resembling a sci-fi scanner.

2. Neon Wireframe Animations

    Include subtle 3D wireframe shapes (e.g., rotating spheres or cuboids) in the background.
    Use a parallax effect so the wireframes move subtly as the user scrolls or moves their mouse.

3. Futuristic Typography Effects

    Add glitch effects to text (e.g., title text flickers like an old monitor).
    Or use a "typing" animation for key phrases in the hero section to mimic a command line interface.

4. Digital Clock/Code Stream

    A small digital clock or matrix-style code stream that scrolls vertically or horizontally, integrated into the page header or side.
    The code could reflect the engine’s backend tech (e.g., Zig syntax snippets).

5. Interactive HUD (Heads-Up Display)

    Add interactive elements that mimic a futuristic HUD.
    Example: Hover effects that display minimalistic diagrams or data on different parts of the landing page.

6. Sci-Fi Cursor with Trails

    Replace the default cursor with a custom sci-fi cursor (e.g., a glowing orb or pointer).
    Add a light trail that follows the cursor’s movement.

7. Holographic Button Effects

    Make your call-to-action buttons look like floating holograms, with glowing outlines and subtle flickers.
    When hovered, they could ripple or shift like projected light.

8. Dynamic Background with Data Streams

    Incorporate a moving background featuring subtle binary code, particles, or a nebula effect that loops seamlessly.

9. Neon Grid Footer

    Add a footer styled like a glowing neon grid, giving the illusion of depth.
    The grid could react to mouse movement, making it feel alive.

10. Futuristic Scroll Bar

    Customize the scroll bar to look like a glowing vertical slider or a sci-fi panel that "charges" as you scroll down.

11. Ambient Audio Option

    Include an optional toggle for ambient audio, like low-frequency hums, beeps, or digital sounds, enhancing the futuristic atmosphere.

12. Interactive Sci-Fi Loading Animation

    Add a loading animation when the page first loads (e.g., a spinning holographic sphere or a progress bar with glowing effects).

13. Rotating Logo or Badge

    Make your logo or a small badge rotate in 3D like a hologram, giving it a tech vibe.

14. Hover-Activated Lighting

    Add a light sweep effect on images or sections when hovered over, like a scanner passing over them.

15. Gaze-Tracking Feature

    For ultimate interactivity: Use gaze-tracking animations (based on cursor position) where elements subtly "tilt" towards the cursor, mimicking a responsive 3D environment.
